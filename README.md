<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project

The main objective of this project is to build a turn based Role Play Game (RPG) using the Javascript Library Phaser 3 for HTML game development. ðŸ•¹

## Live Link

You can play the game right away through this link ðŸ“Ž
[Faune half time demon slayer](https://faune.netlify.app/)

## The game

You will be playing the role of Faune, a mythic supernatural teenager, who has to save her town from the evil forces that try to destroy the reign!

Faune will found her self in the middle of her house with his elf brother, finding out that her neighbors are being attacked by unknown creatures, this is where the story of our heroine starts

### Enemies

Faune will find three different kinds of enemies:

- Lizards *The weakest and most adorable enemy*
- Necromancers *Challenging opponent*
- Ogres *Toughest one*
- Red Dragon *Final boss*

### Attack and score

Every time you hit an opponent your score will be increased by a 100 or 50 depending on the fight style you use

### Turn based and stealth

You can get rid of your opponents in two ways:

- Use distance attacks *more action but gaining less score*
- Have a one on one turned based fight by colliding your opponents *the best way of having the first place*

## How to play

The interaction system is pretty simple, use the **arrow keys** of your keyboard to command Faune to move

The **Space bar** will let Faune perform attacks or interact with some game elements

Also the **Space bar** acts as confirmation button for the user interface menus

You can interact with another characters just by colliding with them, if the interaction is available you will see a dialogue prompt pop up in the screen

### Fighting

When the turn based fight is engaged you will interact the scene through a menu which will indicate you the available options for you

## Road map

It's my desire to keep developing and enhancing this game, in the next, you will be able to see desired features for the game in this section soon

## Prerequisites and instructions
